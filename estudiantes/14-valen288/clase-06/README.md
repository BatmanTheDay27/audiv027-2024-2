Drawing: Pulses By p5

Continuous black flowers with a white circle center draw on a dark grey background as you move your mouse. The circles get bigger as you move your mouse faster and smaller as you move your mouse slower. When you stop your mouse, the last flower rotates slightly.

PERFORMANCE | 2021 - Lisa Jamhoury

Developed during the SloMoCo Spring 2021 Micro-residency DesignSpace, Phoenix, AZ, 2021 Ars Electronica Concrete House (virtual), 2021

Performance set inside a one-person video call. Inside the call, the performer and her mirror image are tracked as two separate people by a machine learning algorithm. As they move closer toward each other, their two bodies combine into one, and the algorithm creates an abstract shape based on the combined body’s movements.
